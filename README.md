# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Info

- This is a React web application that can be used to visualize three different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort.  
- Upon opening the app, the user should click "Generate New Array" to update the screen with a randomized array of rectangles each being between 50 and 500 pixels tall.
- If the user wants to make the array smaller or larger, they can open a slider by clicking "Change Array Size".
- By default, Bubble Sort will be selected as the algorithm to run, however the user can select whichever algorithm they would like to see using the dropdown menu on the top right of the page.
- Once all the options have been selected, the user clicks the "Sort!" button and watches the rectangles get sorted right in front of them.
- This is a responsive web app that has been optimized for all screen sizes
- On smaller screen sizes, it utilizes a hidden menu that can be opened by clicking the hamburger menu icon in the top left of the screen
- A test suite has been coded using Jest and Enzyme
